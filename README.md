# implementation of kaprekar-Constant using python


The Kaprekar Constant, named after the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar, is a unique mathematical concept associated with a process that converges to a specific number. Kaprekar discovered this constant while studying the properties of certain numbers in mathematics.

The Kaprekar Constant is most commonly associated with the number 6174. The process to reach this constant is as follows:

Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits.
Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.
Subtract the smaller number from the larger one.
Repeat this process with the result obtained until the number 6174 is reached.
What makes the Kaprekar Constant fascinating is that, regardless of the starting four-digit number (except for a few exceptions), the process eventually converges to the number 6174 in at most seven iterations. Once 6174 is reached, the process continues to yield 6174 in subsequent iterations.

The mathematical beauty of the Kaprekar Constant lies in its self-replicating and invariant nature, providing a simple yet intriguing example of a mathematical curiosity. It serves as an interesting topic in recreational mathematics and has captured the fascination of mathematicians and enthusiasts alike. The Kaprekar Constant showcases the elegance and unexpected patterns that can emerge from seemingly simple mathematical operations.
